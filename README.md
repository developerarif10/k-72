# K72 Website

## Overview

This project is a clone of the [K72 Agency website](https://k72.ca/), a branding and creative agency site. It replicates the design and functionality using modern web technologies for educational and demonstration purposes. The clone focuses on responsive layouts, interactive elements, and a clean user interface.

**Note:** This is not affiliated with the original K72 Agency. It's built purely as a learning exercise or portfolio piece.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with utility-first classes, enabling rapid and responsive design.
- **Other dependencies**: (Add any additional libraries used, e.g., React Router for navigation, Framer Motion for animations, etc.)

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Interactive sections like project showcases, about page, and contact form (if implemented).
- Smooth animations and transitions.
- Clean, modern aesthetic inspired by the original site's award-winning design.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/developerarif10/k-72.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd k-72
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Development Mode**: Run `npm start` to launch the app with hot reloading.
- **Build for Production**: Run `npm run build` to create an optimized build in the `/build` folder.
- **Deployment**: The build can be deployed to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

Customize the components in `src/components/` and styles via Tailwind config if needed.
